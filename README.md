# BBTAN (FINKI)

### 01. Introduction
**BBTan** (FINKI) - is an attempt to recreate the widely famous and popular BBTAN game, whose popularity is especially noticeable in mobile devices. We felt that the re-implementation of this game would be an ideal project as it covers the more important aspects of the Visual Programming course, especially painting using Windows Forms.

In the following documentations we have outlined the more important things of the project and the implementation itself. For anything else, the demo of the game and the source code can be checked.

### 02. The Game

The game of **BBTan** (FINKI) was implemented in a fixed size window with an 9:16 aspect ratio. The window is of fixed size to make the implementation easier and to assure that the game will be playable on most modern screens.

The main view of the application features three distinct windows:

 1. The top navigation bar, which includes options such as **"New Game"** - to start a brand new game of BBTan, **"Fast Forward"** - speeds up the game etc.
 2. The main window which includes the game and gameplay itself.
 3. The bottom status bar, which shows the current score and also any power up you might have active.
